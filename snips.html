								iOS &amp; Android app for DELWP

								<p>
									Throughout 2016, I lead the team helping DELWP design and develop a new native app, surfacing all of the recreational tracks and sites available in Victoria's state forests.
								</p>
								<p>
									I was reponsible for managing the project, including sprint planning, review and showcases.
								</p>
								<p>
									I also led all design efforts, designing a modern app that anyone already familiar with other mapping apps will easily be able to pickup and use intuitively.
								</p>
								<p>
									A majority of the design work was completed up-front in four weeks, and additional attention was given where required throughout development.
								</p>
								<p>
									As with all software development, we faced more than a few challenges, primarily:
								</p>
								<ul class="measure center lh-copy mv3">
									<li class="mb3">We struggled to find sufficient tooling to prototype map interactions. Given more time for design, using Framer with Mapbox GL could have helped us validate some design decisions early, rather than having to work around problems during development.</li>
									<li class="mb3">The recreation data was only semi-populated, and DELWP revved their efforts to complete it but created issues during development when it came to data validity. It was easy to assume there were problems with our code, when most of the time, the data was malformed or using a non-standard string for <code>null</code>. In the future, we would build out a small data validation process that will allow us to determine the root cause much easier, and optionally produce reports to have data fixed.</li>
									<li>We could have inspected the recreation data more closely before production, as there are some extremem problems with density in a few select but very popular areas in the state.</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="ma0 measure lh-copy center">
									All in all, the app has been very well received, and I am continuing to work on and improve the iOS app in 2018, along with developing an Android version as well.
